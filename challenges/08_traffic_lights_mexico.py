# ./images_breadboard/05_breadboard.png

1. Can you change the program to give the pedestrian longer to cross?
2. Can you find information about other countriesâ€™ traffic light patterns
and reprogram your lights to match?
3. Can you add a second button, so the pedestrian on the other side of the road
can signal they want to cross too?
