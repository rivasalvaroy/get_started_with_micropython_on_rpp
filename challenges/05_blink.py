CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE LEDS
# ./images_breadboard/02_breadboard.png

1. Can you modify the program to light up both the on-board and 
external LEDs at the same time? 
2. Can you write a program which lights up the on-board LED when 
the external LED is switched off, and vice versa? 
3. Can you extend the circuit to include more than one external LED? 
Remember, youâ€™ll need a current-limiting resistor for every LED you use!
