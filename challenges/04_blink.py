CHALLENGE: LONGER LIGHT-UP
# ./images_breadboard/01_breadboard.png

1. How would you change your program to make the LED stay on for longer? 
2. What about staying off for longer? 
3. Whatâ€™s the smallest delay you can use while still seeing the LED switch on and off?
'''

import machine
import utime

# for RPP  (the on-board LED)
# led_onboard = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)
# for RPP W (the on-board LED)
led_onboard = machine.Pin("LED", machine.Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led_onboard.value(1)
    utime.sleep(5)  # 1 changing 5 to a larger number (seconds)
    led_onboard.value(0)
    utime.sleep(5)  # 2 changing 5 to a larger number (seconds)

''' 
utime.sleep()
sleep for the given number of seconds, seconds can be a floating-point number to sleep
for a fractional number of seconds. Note that other MicroPython ports may not accept 
floating-point argument, for compatibility with them use sleep_ms() and sleep_us() functions.

utime.sleep_ms() delay for given number of milliseconds, should be positive or 0.

utime.sleep_us() delay for given number of microseconds, should be positive or 0
